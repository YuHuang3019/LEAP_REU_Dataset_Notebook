# LEAP_REU_Dataset_Notebook

This repository contains two tutorials showing how to carry out climate analysis and apply machine learning techniques using [ClimSim](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.08754) data for [2023 summer REU](https://github.com/leap-stc/LEAP-bootcamps) project at [LEAP center](https://leap.columbia.edu/).

### ML tutorial
Containing two notebooks: 
1. part1 shows how to prepare the data for ML purposes, such as subsampling and normalization
2. part2 shows how to build a simple emulator (MLP model) using ClimSim dataset 

### Climate Analysis tutorial
In this tutorial, we show students how to use Python Xarray for preprocessing, analyzing and visualizing the ClimSim dataset. 

There are two versions:
1. exercise version for student practice
2. tutorial version for presentation of the REU dataset
